"Let &lt;your favourite celebrity> seal the deal for you "


Customized AI Audio Engine for Mercedes Benz

1.  Every customer/client visiting the showroom is important and wants a customized understanding of the product in terms of the AUDIO, the speech, and how the sales representative addresses them, which eventually helps the customer decide.

2. Different types of queries come to the sales team/inquiry team (etc.) regarding details of car, order status, etc. These needs to be handled efficiently in terms of both domain knowledge and VOICE (tone, accent, pitch, amplitude) of the personnel who is handling the call, which again becomes a deciding factor for the customer to take the final decision

Solution :

Our customized AI Audio Engine  "BenzzDuo" can help to tackle both these problem statements.

The tabs or the digital mediums inside the showroom can play the video simulation to demonstrate the features or any other content with the AUDIO being supported according to the users choice of celebrity or any other figure, like Morgan Freeman or Anne Hathway demonstrating the features of the car.

The voices of these famous celebrities can be cloned real time with the content provided on-the-go , as real(quick) as having real time conversation.
The queries of the customers that are coming through the medium of  telephones and call centers can be handled by agents real time , with their accent changing to a famous personality rela time, so the customer hears gets answered for his or her queries in  Morgan freeman's voice or any other preferred voice.
Another feature, that the complete agent can be replaced by our Benzz
Duo AI Agent for answering L1 level of queries.

Same concept can be added for the Customer Screen (Tab) inside the car for answering calls.

Technologies :
The complete application runs on a HTML5 based web browser that can integrate with any call center application like vicidial or any system including Google meet, zoom, cisco Webex or any other platform.

The cloning process is being generated using a vocoder with a Neural Network-based trainer model, so if you want to add new voices into the application, it would require a few hours of voice recording for that specific person. From that moment, all the voices would be trained on that accent.

Integration is one step and does not require any extra hardware or microphone.  It's a SaaS-based product with subscription-based admin functionalities.

Future Plans :
BenzzDuo AI Agent to handle complex queries
Add more personality voices
Adding more Natural voices in the system

BenzzDuo can make a real buzz in the industry of Audio conversation and engagement to standardize the process of interacting with customers, be it on calls or pre-recorded voices.
